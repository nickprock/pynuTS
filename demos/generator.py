# ### [Autoregressive model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model)
# 
# the notation AR(p) refers to the autoregressive model of order p. The AR(p) model is written
# 
# ![AR equation](img/ar.svg)
# 
# where $\varphi _{1},\ldots ,\varphi _{p}$ are parameters, c is a constant, and the random variable $\varepsilon _{t}$ is white noise. The value of p is called the order of the AR model.
# 
# Some constraints are necessary on the values of the parameters so that the model remains stationary. For example, processes in the AR(1) model with ${\displaystyle |\varphi _{1}|\geq 1}$ are not stationary.
